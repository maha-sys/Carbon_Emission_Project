# Carbon_Emission_Project
This project,focuses on analyzing and predicting carbon emissions using real-world climate data.

# Week 1: Data Preparation (Carbon_Emission_Project.ipynb)

Tasks Performed:
-> Loaded the climate change dataset from an Excel file.
-> Inspected the shape and structure of the dataset.
-> Handled missing values and performed data cleaning.
-> Transformed the data into a usable format for analysis.

Technologies Used:
-> pandas
-> numpy

# Week 2: Data Exploration & Visualization (Carbon_Emission_Project_2.ipynb)

Tasks Performed:
-> Uploaded the cleaned dataset.
-> Explored feature relationships and dataset distributions.
-> Performed correlation analysis and plotted heatmaps.
-> Used Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to check multicollinearity.

Visualization Tools:
-> matplotlib
-> seaborn
-> statsmodels

# Week 3: Data Modeling (Carbon_Emission_Project_3.ipynb)

Tasks Performed:
-> Implemented a Random Forest Regressor for predicting carbon emissions.
-> Split data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
-> Evaluated model using RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
-> Performed cross-validation and feature selection.

Libraries Used:
-> scikit-learn
-> pandas
-> numpy 
-> matplotlib

# Project Outcome
This project provides a complete pipeline from raw climate data to a trained machine learning model capable of predicting carbon emission levels. The insights from data visualization helped in selecting features, while the regression model delivered promising results for predictive analytics.
